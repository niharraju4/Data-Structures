# Data-Structures

The	course introduces	basic	Java	programming,	reviews	recursion,	introduces	asymptotic	notations,	and
focuses	mainly	on	linear	data	structures	including	arrays,	linked	lists	and	their	variants,	stacks	
and queues,	and	data	structures	supporting	disjoint-set	operations.	The	implementation	of	the	
basic operations	on	each	data	structure	are	discussed	and	analyzed	in	terms	of	their	efficiency.

Learning	Outcomes	/	Objectives	
The	class	objectives	will	focus	on	teaching	students	the	primary	skills	that	every	good	
programmer	should	be	competent	and	experienced	in.	At	the	conclusion	of	this class,	the	
student	should	acquire	the	following	capabilities:
• Understanding	of	the	Java	programming	language	and	semantics
• Implement	basic	object-oriented programming	techniques
• Test and	debug	their programs
• Identify	correctness	of	programs
• Asses	the performance	characteristics	of	programs
• Implement iterative	and	recursive	solutions	to	problems
• Know	how	and	when	to	use arrays,	linked	lists,	stacks,	and	queues	in	programs
• Implement different sorting	algorithms
